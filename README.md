## General Information
Lending club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. 
Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 
Borrowers who default or fail to repay the money back cause the largest amount of loss to the lending club marketplace.
The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default.
The main objective of  this case study is to apply EDA techniques and  knowledge to analyze lending club loan data, understand the driving factors which is causing more loan defaults, observe the data patterns and  provide risk assessment.

## Conclusions

1.Instead of trying to meet targets, perform background checks on the loans being provided and then provide loan appropriately.
2.Try to get more of upper grade loans and shorter term loans instead of lower grade loans and larger term loans which has more probability of defaulting.
3.People living on mortgage or rental properties have a tendency to default. need more background verification on providing loans to them.
4.Unverified loans provided tend to default most, followed by verified loans. Best to get the information of the source of income of the party taking the loans.
5.People who are employed for more than 10 years and having less annual income(less than 50k) are more likely be defaulters.
6.When loans are provided for debt consolidation, need to take care of the collaterals provided for the loans, so as to improve the chances of recovering the same upon default.
7.Attract more customers for other purpose loans as well, by providing some offers, lower interest rates, etc.
8.Higher the loan amount, followed by higher interest rates result in a higher probability of defaulting of loans. There is higher chances of loan getting defaulted if loan amount, interest rate or installments are higher and annual income is less.
9.Increase the number of recoveries.
